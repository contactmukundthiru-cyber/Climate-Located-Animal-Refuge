These data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey to better understand the interactions between walruses, their habitat, and human activities.<br><br>
It is requested that the authors and the USGS Alaska Science Center be cited for any subsequent publications referenced to this dataset.<br><br>In addition, all raw and processed Argos data, decoded sensor data, comprehensive metadata, and various map visualization products associated with this Movebank Study are available at: <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5066/F7FQ9TP6""target=""_blank"">doi:10.5066/F7FQ9TP6</a><br><br>This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).<br><br><u>Specific to this Movebank Study:</u></br></br>Transmitter deployment locations have been manually added to each track. These records are not Argos data, and the 'comments' variable for these records has been coded '<i>manually_added_deployment_location</i>'. There are also manually added 'end' locations for tags believed to have detatched from the walrus while on land (based on sensor and location data). The comments variable for these records has been coded '<i>manually_added_onshore_shuck_location_estimate</i>'. These end locations are weighted averages of all Argos locations collected up to 7-days post-detachment. The Argos Location Class was used for weighting, with LC 3,2,1,0,A,B,Z assigned weights of 100,75,50,15,15,2,1 respectively. Location estimates based on a small sample of low-quality locations were sometimes misrepresentative, in which case the estimates were manually revised to coincide with a nearby coastal site while recognizing well-known frequently-used walrus haulouts. Finally, data for individuals #172 and #174 were actually collected from the same walrus that was instrumented with 2 tags.<br><br>
